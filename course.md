Even the bells love it!

We're not all born Morris dancers! Few Morris dancers come from a Morris dancing background; we tried it and loved it, and you can have a go too.

Every year in the autumn, we run evening taster sessions so you too can come along and find out what it's all about:

*   Wednesday 21st September
*   Wednesday 28th September
*   Wednesday 5th October

from 8pm until 10pm.

You can find us at the Gardeners Hall, St Leonards Rd, Windsor, [SL4 3DR](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=gardeners+hall+win

[Contact us](wm_contact.html) for further details or if you would like to come along.

See if you can tell your left foot from your right!

*   and much more!

### Find out the answers to:

*   What are the origins of the Morris?
