We're not all born Morris dancers! 

Few Morris dancers come from a Morris dancing background; we tried it and loved it, and you can have a go too.

Every year in the autumn, we run evening taster sessions so you too can come along and find out what it's all about:

* Wednesday 27th September
* Wednesday 3rd October
* Wednesday 10th October

from 8pm until 10pm.

You can find us at the Gardeners Hall, St Leonards Rd, Windsor, [SL4 3DR](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ll=51.470932,-0.620298&spn=0.010693,0.014656&cid=0,0,2946314239303318482&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A).

[Contact us](contact.html) for further details or if you would like to come along.

### See if you can tell your left foot from your right!

### Dance to live music!

### How do you handle your hankies?

#### Learn to do:

* _single-stepping_
* _short rear-ups(!)_
* _the 'Hey'_
* _capers_
* and much more!

### Find out the answers to:

* What are the origins of the Morris?
* Are women allowed to do it?
* What is a melodeon, anyway?

Although membership of Windsor Morris is by invitation only, **everyone is welcome** to join us at these sessions.
